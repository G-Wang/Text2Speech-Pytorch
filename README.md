# Text2Speech-Pytorch
A Text2Speech engine for Pytorch.

## NOTE: Heavily Work in Progress

This repo will hold various TTS modules, from frontends such as tacotron and deepvoice to neural vocoder backends such as wavenet and wavernn.

The main goal is to have everything in one place, in one framework and with a bit more modular structure.

More importantly this is for self learning as I try to implement the various models and architectures.

Contributions are welcomed!

# Features (Like to have)
* single speaker/multi speaker dataset support
* modular components
* support for prototyping new models (i.e resusable modules for seq2seq, attention, fully conv nets, transformer, etc)
